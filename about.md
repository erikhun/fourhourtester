The idea for this site came to us while we were working on our talk for [TestBash Manchester 2016](http://www.ministryoftesting.com/training-events/testbash-manchester/): The 4-hour Tester Experiment. (Which in turn was inspired by Timothy Ferriss's "The 4-Hour Chef".)

If you want to contribute any exercises or solutions, you can either send us a mail at [fourhourtester@gmail.com](mailto:fourhourtester@gmail.com) or submit a pull request to [the repository of this site](https://github.com/j19sch/fourhourtester).
