## Exercise

Feature: Adding and editing new event

Week view, new event default duration 1 hour
Clicking away after clicking once, starts to create a new event right away (! simple clicking away can be a bit annoying like this)
Default calendar is thw own
No default title, placeholder with example
Event can be created right away

After creation, clicking on event’s title, or double-click on event opens it up for editing.
Single click, “original” creation pop-up of the event pops-up
(how to write continously notes?)
Now you can change the color of the event

Hover-over
? A strange, little clock symbol is shown on the pop-up - what’s that?
Now you can extend or shorten the duration of the event

If there are more events next to each other, the longer ones are on the left

EDIT page of the event
B change event to ‘full day’, change it back to specific hour and it loses the original time

Edit mode pop-up now contains ‘who is invited’, ‘place of the event’, ‘if video call is available’.
! Attendance can be changed ? where do I set it up later?
Symbol of maybe going is a question mark

## Evaluation

1. I started out by looking at the immediate pop-up when creating an event. Went through it’s functions and displays. After it’s creation another “read” type of pop-up. Only then I started to look at the more complicated Edit mode.

2. Not amazingly clear. Hard to get an idea of the train of thought. For sure, for others it would be way harder.

3. Clear separation of what I did and what I saw. More consequent tone.
