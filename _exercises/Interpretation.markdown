## Briefing
Words mean different things to different people. And when we string words together into sentences, it gets only worse. So it's important to be aware of the many different interpretations people might give to one and the same sentence.

A good way to explore these different meanings is play of words. Of the many many options we selected the "Mary had a little lamb."-heuristic. By stressing different words in a sentence, different interpretations arise:

|Statement                   |In contrast to                       |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
|**Mary**​ had a little lamb  |... it was hers, not someone else’s  |
|Mary  **had**​ a little lamb |... but she doesn’t have it anymore  |
|Mary had ​**a**  little lamb |... just one, not several            |
|Mary had a **little**​ lamb  |... it was very, very small          |
|Mary had a little ​ **lamb** |... not a goat, a chicken, etc       |
|**Mary had**​ a little lamb  |... but John still has his           |

And note that we didn't even yet go into the different possible meanings of "to have":

- Mary owned a lamb.
- Mary gave birth to a small sheep.
- Mary ate some mutton.
- Mary conned a mild-mannered person.

## Exercise
Time limit in total: 30 minutes

Take the second sentence from this quote and apply Mary had a little lamb:
_"You can add reminders in Google Calendar. Reminders carry over to the next day until you mark them as done. For example, if you create a reminder to make a restaurant reservation, you'll see the reminder each day until you mark it as done."_ - <a href="https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/6285327?hl=en&ref_topic=6076998">https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/6285327?hl=en&ref_topic=6076998</a>

Come up with at least 10 different interpretations.

## Evaluation
1. Which interpretations are widely different from your own initial one?
1. How different could two implementations be, if their developers had two different interpretations?
1. What kind of behaviors would be bugs based on one interpretation of the sentence but not on another?
